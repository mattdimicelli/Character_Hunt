## My process

### Built with

- React (functional components utilizing hooks)
- Tailwind CSS
- gh-pages (to assist with pushing the app to Github Pages)
- react-scrolls, for smooth scrolling feature
- react-icons, to provide a standardized API to manipulate and utilize icons
  from different sources
- a personally and custom-made "Spanish" icon
- Intersection-Observer API
- A mobile-first, responsive design

### What I learned

I learned about the HTML `<map>` element, it's use cases and syntax, and how 
it is associated with an `<img>`.  I realized that as the size of the `<img>`
changed (due to responsive design) the `<map>` functionality would break.  react-
image-map creates an ImageMap component which solves this problem using percent-based
map areas.
